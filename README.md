Wireframing

Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a digital product or user interface.  
It focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than colors, fonts, or final design details.

Importance in the Design Process
- **Clarity**: Helps designers and stakeholders align on the structure before development begins.  
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and cost by identifying issues early.  
- **Collaboration**: Provides a shared visual reference for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Iteration**: Makes it easy to test and refine ideas quickly before moving to high-fidelity designs.
