Wireframing

Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a digital product or user interface.  
It focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than colors, fonts, or final design details.

Importance in the Design Process
- **Clarity**: Helps designers and stakeholders align on the structure before development begins.  
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and cost by identifying issues early.  
- **Collaboration**: Provides a shared visual reference for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Iteration**: Makes it easy to test and refine ideas quickly before moving to high-fidelity designs.

 Key Elements of a Wireframe

When creating a wireframe, several elements are important to show how a design will look and work:

 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall skeleton of the page (e.g., header, footer, sidebars).  
*Example:* A simple two-column layout helps decide where text and images will sit.

2. Navigation
Shows how users move between pages (menus, links, buttons).  
*Example:* A top navigation bar ensures quick access to important sections.

3. Content Placement
Highlights where text, images, or videos will appear.  
*Example:* A hero section at the top with a large image and headline captures attention.

4. Functionality
Represents interactive features like forms, search bars, or sliders.  
*Example:* A login form box shows where users will enter details to sign in.
