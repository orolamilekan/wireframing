Wireframing

Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a digital product or user interface.  
It focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than colors, fonts, or final design details.

Importance in the Design Process
- **Clarity**: Helps designers and stakeholders align on the structure before development begins.  
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and cost by identifying issues early.  
- **Collaboration**: Provides a shared visual reference for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Iteration**: Makes it easy to test and refine ideas quickly before moving to high-fidelity designs.

 Key Elements of a Wireframe

When creating a wireframe, several elements are important to show how a design will look and work:

 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall skeleton of the page (e.g., header, footer, sidebars).  
*Example:* A simple two-column layout helps decide where text and images will sit.

2. Navigation
Shows how users move between pages (menus, links, buttons).  
*Example:* A top navigation bar ensures quick access to important sections.

3. Content Placement
Highlights where text, images, or videos will appear.  
*Example:* A hero section at the top with a large image and headline captures attention.

4. Functionality
Represents interactive features like forms, search bars, or sliders.  
*Example:* A login form box shows where users will enter details to sign in.







Types of Wireframe

The wireframes presented in this project are High-Fidelity Wireframes.

Justification:

The screens in the image show real UI components such as images, buttons, input fields, and text.

Each screen has a clear layout that reflects an actual application design (e.g., Splash, Sign In, Home, Detail, Reservation).

The wireframes use color, real branding, and content that simulates the final product.

These high-fidelity wireframes are likely being used in the final stages of the design phase to hand off to developers or to demonstrate a functional prototype for feedback.




 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be divided into two main types:

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Simple, sketch-like representations of a design.  
- Usually black and white, with boxes for images and lines for text.  
- Focus on **layout and structure** rather than details.  
- Useful in the **early stages** of design to brainstorm and get feedback quickly.  

 Example: A rough sketch of a website with placeholders saying ‚ÄúHeader,‚Äù ‚ÄúMenu,‚Äù ‚ÄúImage here,‚Äù ‚ÄúButton.‚Äù

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes
- More polished and closer to the actual design.  
- Includes fonts, colors, spacing, and sometimes clickable interactions.  
- Focus on **visual design and user experience details.**  
- Used later in the design process, often before prototyping or UI design.  

 Example: A detailed wireframe that looks almost like the final website, showing actual text, styled buttons, and layout.


 Popular Wireframing Tools

There are several tools available for creating wireframes, each offering unique features to help designers visualize and plan their projects. Some commonly used tools include:

- **Balsamiq** ‚Äì Great for quick, sketch-like wireframes that keep the focus on structure rather than details.  
- **Adobe XD** ‚Äì Powerful tool for both wireframing and prototyping, with strong design features.  
- **Sketch** ‚Äì Popular among Mac users for UI/UX design.  
- **Figma** ‚Äì A web-based tool that allows real-time collaboration and is very popular for wireframing and prototyping.  

 Why Figma?
Figma is one of the most recommended wireframing tools because:  
- It‚Äôs **free to start** and works in the browser (no need to install heavy software).  
- It allows **real-time collaboration** ‚Äî multiple people can work on the same file at once.  
- It‚Äôs **cross-platform** (Windows, Mac, Linux, and even mobile).  
- You can design **low-fidelity wireframes** (simple shapes and layouts) and also scale up to **high-fidelity prototypes** with colors, fonts, and interactions.  
- It integrates easily with other tools and is widely used in professional design teams.

üëâ In short, Figma makes it easy to go from **ideas ‚Üí wireframes ‚Üí prototypes** all in one place.
