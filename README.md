Wireframing

Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation of a digital product or user interface.  
It focuses on structure, layout, and functionality rather than colors, fonts, or final design details.

Importance in the Design Process
- **Clarity**: Helps designers and stakeholders align on the structure before development begins.  
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and cost by identifying issues early.  
- **Collaboration**: Provides a shared visual reference for designers, developers, and clients.  
- **Iteration**: Makes it easy to test and refine ideas quickly before moving to high-fidelity designs.

 Key Elements of a Wireframe

When creating a wireframe, several elements are important to show how a design will look and work:

 1. Layout Structure
Defines the overall skeleton of the page (e.g., header, footer, sidebars).  
*Example:* A simple two-column layout helps decide where text and images will sit.

2. Navigation
Shows how users move between pages (menus, links, buttons).  
*Example:* A top navigation bar ensures quick access to important sections.

3. Content Placement
Highlights where text, images, or videos will appear.  
*Example:* A hero section at the top with a large image and headline captures attention.

4. Functionality
Represents interactive features like forms, search bars, or sliders.  
*Example:* A login form box shows where users will enter details to sign in.


Types of Wireframe


The wireframes presented in this project are High-Fidelity Wireframes.

Justification:

The screens in the image show real UI components such as images, buttons, input fields, and text.

Each screen has a clear layout that reflects an actual application design (e.g., Splash, Sign In, Home, Detail, Reservation).

The wireframes use color, real branding, and content that simulates the final product.

These high-fidelity wireframes are likely being used in the final stages of the design phase to hand off to developers or to demonstrate a functional prototype for feedback.
